		<h1>
			Website Design Document
		</h1>

		<h2>
			Audience
		</h2>
		<p>
			The audience is intended to be those who are fans of the Fallout series or those who wish to learn more about it.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Content
		</h2>
		<p>
			I have decided that this website will be a page dedicated to the first two Fallout games, developed by Interplay.  It will contain information about the games and their development as well as fun facts, images and other cool things about the games.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Consultation
		</h2>
		<p>
			The consultation of the website will be asking my coworkers if it looks cool and if there is anything that can be improved.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Accuracy
		</h2>
		<p>
			Content on the website will be researched and with sources provided if needed to give as much accuracy as possible.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Accessibility
		</h2>
		<p>
			The format of the website will be laid out as simply as possible so screen readers can parse it easily, as well as tagging images with titles or captions for said screen readers.  For a basic website, this is the most that can be done, as allowing your website to be as understandable as possible to the browser means that its own accessibility tools will work better.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Language
		</h2>
		<p>
			The markup language used to developed the website will be HTML as that is the markup language required for websites.  CSS will also be used to style the markup language.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Development Tools
		</h2>
		<p>
			Notepad++ will be used to make the website, because it is fast, has cool features and I like it.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Style
		</h2>
		<p>
			For the style of the website, I will be attempting to mix a modern, clean design with the retro-futuristic look of the Fallout games so it is not cumbersome to navigate, but still shows what the games were like in the best and most authentic way.  This means the colour palette will consist mostly of dull browns and silvers, as well as off-white and digital green.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Sitemap
		</h2>
		<p>
			The site will be structured as a single linear column for easy readability, with an index, a page on Fallout 1, and a page on Fallout 2, for a total of 3 pages.
		</p>
		<pre>

		</pre>

		<h2>
			Testing
		</h2>
		<p>
			For testing the site, I will use my coworkers and ask what they think of it and what could be improved.  I can also use a web accessibility checker to see how compliant my site is with WCAG standards.
